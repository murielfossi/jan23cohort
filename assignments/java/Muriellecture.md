In Spring MVC, whenever you import Model into your controller you can use it as a container to store data and pass that data to the view engine. Data can be any type: objects, strings, numbers, even dates! And you can use it in any of your method signatures. When the framework gets a request mapped to that function, it will automatically create that Model instance container, the model variable in our code below. This is an example of dependency injection.

Think of it like an empty cup that gets created, filled up with little boxes of data, that then get poured into the template as it's being rendered.
